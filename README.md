# Best_algorithm_for_my_thesis
Some trials to determinate the best machine learning algorithm for my thesis

I try with 3 different machine learning techniques:
-Neural_network (MLP)
-kNN_regression
-SVM_regression

After a systematic evaluation, I found that the best technique for my thesis is a Neural_network with one hidden layer with 25 neurons with sigmoidal activation function.
